# 🧠 Dyslexia Detection using Machine Learning + Flask

This project presents a full machine learning pipeline for the diagnosis of dyslexia based on structured questionnaire data and natural language-derived features. It includes preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and deployment.

✅ The trained model is deployed using a **Flask web application**, allowing real-time predictions through a user-friendly interface.

## 🔍 Key Features

- Preprocessed and merged real-world datasets
- Balanced imbalanced classes using SMOTE
- Extracted and selected top features using ExtraTreesClassifier
- Trained and evaluated 12 different classifiers
- Visualized results using heatmaps, bar charts, ROC curve, and confusion matrix
- 🔥 Integrated the best-performing model into a **Flask web app** for deployment
